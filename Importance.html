<ul>
  <li align=justify> We study literature so that we can better appreciate our literary heritage. </li> <br>
  <li align=justify> We cannot appreciate something that we do not understand.</li> </br>
  <li align=justify>Through a study of our literature, we can trace the rich heritage of ideas handed down to us from our forefathers. Then we can understand ourselves better and take pride in being a Filipino. Like other races of the world, we need to understand that we have a great and noble tradition which can serve as the means to assimilate other cultures. </li> <br>
  <li align=justify> Through such a study, we will realize our literary limitations conditioned by certain historical factors and we can take steps to overcome them. Above all, as Filipinos, who truly love and take pride in our own culture, we have to manifest our deep concern for our own literature and this we can do by studying the literature of our country. </br>
